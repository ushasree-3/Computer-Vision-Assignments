# Assignment D: Optical Flow and Image Warping
 
**Task**:  
- Implemented the **Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm** from scratch for motion estimation between video frames.
- Developed **image warping** techniques using the computed optical flow to interpolate frames and compare accuracy with the actual frames.

This assignment demonstrates the application of optical flow for motion analysis and image processing tasks.
