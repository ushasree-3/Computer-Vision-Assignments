# Computer Vision Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments completed as part of the **Computer Vision** course.

## Assignment A: Image Noise and Denoising
- **Description**: Implemented image noise addition algorithms including impulse noise (salt and pepper) and Gaussian noise. Followed by image denoising using different filtering methods like Box Filter, Gaussian Filter, and Median Filter. 
- **Key Techniques**: Noise addition, convolution, filter-based denoising.

## Assignment B: Gaussian Pyramid, Laplacian Pyramid, and Corner Detection
- **Description**: Implemented the Gaussian Pyramid downsampling method and compared it with OpenCV resizing. Followed by the implementation of image blending using Laplacian Pyramids. Additionally, developed Harris and Hessian Corner Detection algorithms from scratch.
- **Key Techniques**: Image pyramids, convolution, corner detection, image blending.

## Assignment C: Image Stitching and Panorama Creation
- **Description**: Focused on finding homography matrices and stitching multiple images to create a panorama. Involved feature matching, homography estimation, and image warping.
- **Key Techniques**: Feature matching, homography estimation, image warping, panorama creation.

## Assignment D: Optical Flow and Image Warping
- **Description**: Implemented the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm to estimate motion between consecutive video frames. Used optical flow for image warping to interpolate frames, and compared the warped images with actual frames.
- **Key Techniques**: Optical flow, Lucas-Kanade method, image warping.

## Assignment E: Stereo Vision and Disparity Map
- **Description**: Implemented camera matrix estimation and stereo rectification from scratch. Then, computed disparity maps from stereo image pairs to estimate depth information.
- **Key Techniques**: Stereo vision, camera calibration, disparity map computation.
